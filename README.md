# Swift-Cake
As engineers we're asked a great deal of coding questions. In my efforts to study up on data structures and algorithms I haven't found many (read: none) resources answering any of the questions asked by high tiered company answered via Swift.

The goal of this project is to solve answers asked by interviewers at these top companies, but in Swift--and most importantly--with an explanation. 

##Who is this for?
This repositiory is meant to supply anyone interested in interview problems solved using Swift but also includes a step-by-step analysis of the problem solving process undertaken.  

If you're interested in contributing just fork and submit a PR! I'd like to make this a community project a la the Swift Algorithm Club.

I'm also going to try my best to add nifty, functional Swift solutions to problems when I can.
