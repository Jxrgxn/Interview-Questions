# Swift-Cake
As engineers we're asked a great deal of coding questions. In my efforts to study up on data structures and algorithms I haven't found many (read: none) resources answering any of the questions asked by high tiered company answered via Swift.

The goal of this project is to solve answers asked by interviewers at these top companies, but in Swift--and most importantly--with an explanation.

This repositiory is meant to supply anyone interest with interview problems solved with Swift but also include step-by-step analysis.

I'm also going to try my best to add nifty, functional Swift solutions to problems when I can.
